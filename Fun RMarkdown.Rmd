```{r intro, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
# Loading Libraries
```{r library, message = F, warning = F}
library("vegan")
library("ggplot2")
```


```{r dune, message = F, warning = F}
# The following code chunk loads the dune data from the vegan package and preforms a log transformation using the log1p function

data(dune)
dune2 <- dune
log_dune2 <- log1p(dune2)

```


```{r transformation, message = F, warning = F}
# Perform nmds on dune2 and extract points from nmds 
meta_dune2 <- metaMDS(dune2)
dpoint <- meta_dune2$points

```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
